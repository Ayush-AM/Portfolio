# Fixing Vercel Deployment Issues

## Current Issue

Your Vercel deployment is failing during the build process. Based on the error message:

```
Running build in Washington, D.C., USA (East) – iad1
Build machine configuration: 2 cores, 8 GB
Cloning github.com/Ayush-AM/Portfolio (Branch: main, Commit: 2b4784c)
Previous build caches not available
Cloning completed: 433.000ms
Running "vercel build"
Vercel CLI 44.6.4

  run `npm fund` for details
Detected Next.js version: 15.4.2
Running "npm run build"
> ayush-portfolio@0.1.0 build
```

The build process is starting but not completing. This is likely due to missing environment variables or configuration issues.

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Add Environment Variables to Vercel**

   Your local `.env` file contains:
   ```
   AUTH_SECRET="7FMPIHAGzGG6uOpVzyaA1Je/eYJo3pvPoPvGOHg5UEQ="
   AUTH_DISCORD_ID="dummy_discord_id"
   ```

   Add these to your Vercel project:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the following variables:
     - `AUTH_SECRET`: `7FMPIHAGzGG6uOpVzyaA1Je/eYJo3pvPoPvGOHg5UEQ=`
     - `AUTH_DISCORD_ID`: `dummy_discord_id`
     - `AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET`: Add a dummy value like `dummy_discord_secret`
     - `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION`: `true`

2. **Verify vercel.json Configuration**

   We've created a `vercel.json` file with the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "installCommand": "npm install",
     "framework": "nextjs",
     "outputDirectory": ".next",
     "env": {
       "SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION": "true"
     }
   }
   ```

   This should help Vercel properly configure your deployment.

3. **Redeploy Your Project**

   After adding the environment variables and verifying the configuration:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Click on "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment
   - Or push a new commit to your repository to trigger a new deployment

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Build Logs**

   - Review the complete build logs in Vercel for specific error messages
   - Look for any missing dependencies or configuration issues

2. **Try Deploying with Vercel CLI**

   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI if you haven't already
   npm i -g vercel

   # Login to Vercel
   vercel login

   # Deploy from your project directory
   vercel --prod
   ```

   This will provide more detailed error messages if there are issues.

3. **Simplify Authentication Requirements**

   If you're not actively using authentication in your portfolio, you can modify `src/env.js` to make the auth variables optional during production:

   ```javascript
   server: {
     AUTH_SECRET:
       process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
         ? z.string().optional()
         : z.string().optional(),
     AUTH_DISCORD_ID: z.string().optional(),
     AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET: z.string().optional(),
     // ...
   }
   ```

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Set Up Proper Authentication**

   If you need authentication for your portfolio:
   - Generate proper Discord OAuth credentials at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Update the environment variables in Vercel with real values

2. **Configure Custom Domain**

   - In Vercel Dashboard, go to your project settings
   - Navigate to Domains
   - Add your custom domain and follow the instructions

3. **Enable Analytics**

   - In Vercel Dashboard, go to your project settings
   - Navigate to Analytics
   - Enable analytics to monitor your site's performance
