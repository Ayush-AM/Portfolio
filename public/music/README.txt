# Background Music

To add background music to your portfolio, place an MP3 file named 'background-ambient.mp3' in this directory.

The file should be:
- Ambient/instrumental music that's not distracting
- Optimized for web (smaller file size)
- Properly licensed for your use

You can find royalty-free music on sites like:
- Pixabay
- Mixkit
- Free Music Archive
- SoundCloud (with Creative Commons licenses)

Once added, the BackgroundMusic component will automatically play this file with user controls.
